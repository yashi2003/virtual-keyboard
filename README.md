# Virtual Keyboard
The Virtual Keyboard is an innovative Computer Vision project that allows users to type using hand gestures detected by a webcam. This project replaces the need for a physical keyboard by enabling users to interact with a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen.

## Project Description
The Virtual Keyboard promotes a new way of typing by recognizing hand gestures. The webcam detects the user's hand, and specific fingers act as cursors on the computer screen. As the user moves their hand, the corresponding keys on the virtual keyboard are "pressed" based on the detected gestures.

### Features
  1. Real-time hand detection and tracking using OpenCV
  2. Virtual keyboard layout displayed on the screen
  3. Typing functionality by detecting specific hand gestures
  4. Customizable keyboard layout
